## General ##
The reason for this project was to integrate the CAT-toilet "CATGenie120" into my smarthome and to make it possible to lock a toilet while an other one is cleaning.

 

**The most important for me was:**


- new board replaces the original one


- synchronice 2 or more CATGenies


- integration into my openhab2 smarthome control


- hot water for cleaning


- Using my own admixture to reduce smell

**Design of the controll board:**


- Arduino with WIFI (Genuino MKR1000)


- EEPROM for WEB-Page and cleaning programs (both can be uploaded)


- Real time clock (without power running for at least 1 day)


- Hardware watchdog


- RS485 Interface for syncronisation
