Advices for soldering board
---------------------------
You need 3 soldering tips
0,8mm (for IC's)
1,6mm (for resistors, small capacitors)
3,2mm (for relais, power supply, big capacitors)

solder wire 0,5mm and 1mm

a good fix mounted magnifying glass with light

1. Soilder the SMD IC's, transistors (0,8mm)
2. Soilder the SMD resistors + capacitors (1,6mm)
3. Big Components (3,2mm)

As there is nearly no space between the power supply block and the MKR1000
both shoud be soldered together. Otherwise putting the MKR1000 into the sockets could be a problem.


Important !!!!!
Some board connectors seem to be different depending where you bought the CATGenie. (Check it first)
